Abstract
Efficient drone path planning presents a crucial challenge for optimizing unmanned aerial systems, particularly when extensive coverage and precision are required. This study investigates how strategic positioning of launch pads influences drone path planning, with a focus on minimizing energy consumption and enhancing operational efficiency. By employing the multiple Traveling Salesman Problem (mTSP) algorithm, our research examines the impact of launch pad repositioning on drone route assignment and configuration. We utilize genetic algorithms to identify near-optimal launch pad locations, achieving 97-100\% accuracy compared to brute-force methods while requiring significantly less computational timeâ€”up to four orders of magnitude faster. Our findings demonstrate that optimizing launch pad location substantially reduces redundant travel distances, thereby improving overall mission performance. We further explore adaptive termination criteria and smart population initialization techniques to balance solution quality with computational efficiency. This research highlights the importance of adaptive deployment strategies in designing energy-aware drone systems, providing practical insights for real-world applications where both solution quality and computational efficiency are critical operational factors.
