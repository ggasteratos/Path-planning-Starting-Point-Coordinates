Due to the large volume of data (17+ million tests) for SA and PSO a SQLite database was used as excel couldnâ€™t handle it. To be able to reconstruct the database, download all files and unzip them. This process will create a SQLite 3 database file locally. To view the full data in it, you can use this tool https://sqlitebrowser.org/ . Ta data for all graphs for SA and PSO were extracted using the views in the database.
